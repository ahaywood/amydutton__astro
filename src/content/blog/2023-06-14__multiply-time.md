As I've experimented with AI, I've gotten the most excitement from increasing my productivity and scaling in a way previously only possible for teams.

For example, with **Flowjin**, I can take our Compresed.fm episodes and have it generate clips that can be shared.

With **Video Tap**, I can take a video, and generate a description, tags, subtitles, transcripts, Tweets, and blog posts. ðŸ¤¯

With **ChaptGPT**, I can generate hundreds of thousands of content ideas.

**Grammarly** has helped me rewrite paragraph after paragraph, making my writing clearer and more concise (including this one).

**MidJourney** has created custom artwork, where previously, it would have taken hours to find something suitable or days to draw.

With **Notion AI**, I can write summaries for clipped content I save, or run prompt commands based on the page's content.

**CoPilot** has helped me write code, understand codebases, and provide advanced auto-completion.

As a solo creator, I've been blown away by how quickly I've accomplished tasks that previously would have taken hours, if not days.

The possibilities are endless -- And that is something to be very excited about.
