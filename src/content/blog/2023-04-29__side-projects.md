I have no shortage of ideas. For most people, the problem isn't coming up with ideas, it's executing them. That's why we have common phrases like "Ideas are a dime a dozen." **For the idea to become valuable, you have to act on it.** Turn it into a reality. With such an abundance of options, the harder question becomes, "What idea do I invest my time in?"

ðŸ”· **Use the RICE formula.** The RICE formula was developed by a team at Intercom to help prioritize which projects and features need to be built. Each option is assigned numbers based on the project's Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. Then, using a mathematical formula, rank your projects. I love this process because it allows me to approach ideas objectively. I tend to attach feelings, hopes, and desires to my ideas. They're mine. The RICE formula allows me to take a step back and consider other important factors I might have otherwise ignored.

ðŸ”· **Make small bets.** What is the smallest piece of the project you can deliver? Do that! The first iteration may not be amazing but iterate on it. Make it better over time. It's important that you ship, get feedback, and see if your project resonates with others. Why waste time building a huge, perfect project that no one else is interested in?

ðŸ”· **Don't get distracted by the latest and greatest idea.** Within Notion, I keep a running list of all my ideas. This way, I don't lose an idea but can let it percolate and mature. I'll continue to add details and definitions, allowing the project to take shape. Then, when the time is right, I have all the information I need in a single location. This process allows me to set it on the back burner without distracting from the work that I've already committed to and what needs to get done.

**What other considerations and filters do you use?**
