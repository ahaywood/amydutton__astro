I try to improve with each project I work on. I build in a challenge. I go beyond the familiar. I make it harder on myself and raise the stakes. This ensures that I'm constantly learning and growing with each new project. I'm able to stretch my skills and knowledge, building expertise and creating a diverse portfolio.

This could be as simple as experimenting with a new CSS technique or as complicated as learning a new framework.

Experimentation encourages creativity and innovation, leading to new and unexpected outcomes.

Yes, this might be uncomfortable at first, but growth comes from pushing boundaries.

Progress is not always linear, and challenges may be daunting at times. But lean in and develop a growth mindset.

Dare to go beyond what you know, set big goals, and embrace challenges. Your professional development and personal satisfaction will be all the more rewarding as you witness continuous improvement in your work.
