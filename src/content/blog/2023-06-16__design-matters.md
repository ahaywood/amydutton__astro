If you're just starting out in design, I'd tell you to focus on what really matters. So, what really matters?

## The principles of design matter.

Know the principles, even if you choose to break them. Design is purposeful. Most great designs combine at least half of them, if not all of them.

## The end-user matters.

Without the end user, no one will use your product. Their pain points, needs, and desires all matter. You can't afford to alienate or ignore them.

## The stakeholders matter.

Stakeholders have a vested interest in your product -- This could be financial, reputation, or social impact. They are affected and can affect the project's outcome. It's important to communicate with them throughout the course of the project to ensure their needs and expectations are considered and addressed properly.

## The business cases matter.

The business cases matter because they justify the project and outline its expected benefits, costs, risks, and constraints. It helps stakeholders understand the purpose and objects and provides a basis for decision-making, resource allocation, and risk management. Without a solid business case, a project may lack support, fail to secure necessary resources or fail to deliver expected benefits.

Of course you can never guarantee success, but if you focus on what matters, you're more likely to get there.
