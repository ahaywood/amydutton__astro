Imposter Syndrome is a huge buzzword in the tech community. It's the label that describes feeling like a fraud or phony and doubting our own abilities. Everyone seems to have it. You're uncool if you don't. (or, maybe just arrogant?)

## You don't have Imposter Syndrome. You're not pretending to be someone else. You deserve to be here. We want you here. You're confusing imposter syndrome with a different feeling.

With technology, everything is constantly changing. I started in tech 22 years ago. I couldn't survive now on the best practices we used then. If you want to stay current, you have to be constantly learning.

**Learning is uncomfortable.** You feel clumsy and awkward. There's self-doubt. **It's _that feeling_ you struggle with.**

If you're always learning something new, then you're constantly feeling uncomfortable. **There's nothing wrong with that.** It's actually a good thing. **It's growing pains.**

## Your propensity for success within tech is directly proportionate to your ability to get comfortable with what you do and don't know.
