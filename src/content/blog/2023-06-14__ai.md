Over the past few weeks, I've experimented with AI (just like the rest of the world).

I've gone from skeptic to amazed, and fearful to excited. I've worried, "Will this take my job?" And wondered, "Even if this just augments my job, will I like the job I'm left with?"

As I've contemplated the future, I've taken comfort in this statistic:

> 85% of employment growth in the last 80 years came from new jobs. So, AKA, between 1940 and today, 85% of employment came from jobs that did not exist in 1940...Before 2008/2009, the idea of a social media manager did not exist; the idea of a UX designer did not exist...Hundreds of thousands of people now do these jobs.

**It's been a good reminder that change isn't always bad, it's just different, and if we want to continue to stay relevant it's important to stay open-minded and be willing to adapt.**
