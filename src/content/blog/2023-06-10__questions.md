One of the best ways to close a knowledge gap is to ask questions. Ask lots of questions.

One of my favorite creators is Swyx. He does a fantastic job of learning and building in public. In fact, he's made a lot of his notes and thoughts public on GitHub ([swyxio/brain](https://github.com/swyxio/brain)). Some of my favorite notes are in his "Better Questions" section, where he collects good questions and notes about what kinds of questions to ask:

> Never ask a yes/no question. Don't ask "Are you satisfied with your current provider?" rather "What do you like/dislike about your current provider". The wrong answer to a yes/no question ends the conversation

There are also questions for various scenarios. A few of my favorites revolve around job interviews:

- What should I be worried about in joining the company?
- What's the most difficult feedback you've received in your career, and how did it change you?

And personal life direction:

- In what area of my life am I settling?
- What battles do you choose?
- What are you letting in?
- Am I spending time with the right people? Who are the five I want to spend time with?
- In what ways am I in my own way?

I wish more people would be intentional about the questions we ask and the knowledge gap we try to fill
