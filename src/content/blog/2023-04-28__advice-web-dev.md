I have been building websites for 22 years. In some ways, I feel like we grew up together. Things are different now than when I started. There's more. More options. More tech. But, more awesome.

If I were starting over today, this is the advice I'd give myself:

## Advice #1: Build Things

The **absolute best thing** you can do is build things. This moves you from tutorial hell and applies the knowledge you've gained. The process of trying to build a feature, failing, struggling, troubleshooting, debugging, googling, and succeeding is the best education.

## Advice #2: Start with the Frontend

There are so many entry points and areas where you can go deep. It's hard to know what to focus on or where you should spend your energy. My recommendation? Start with the front end. Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's incredibly satisfying to write code and see it work within the browser. Once comfortable, you can use JavaScript to go full-stack and learn the backend.

## Advice #3: Network

Networking sounds business-y, but a **network is really just your group of friends.** No one goes at this alone. Even the Lone Ranger had his horse Silver. My friends have supported me, helped solve my problems, and sent work my way.

Be active on LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord, and Blue Sky (if you have an invite ðŸ˜©). Go to conferences. Attend webinars and virtual events. Make connections. It really does make a difference.

I'm grateful for the experiences that I've had and love being able to pass on the knowledge and insights I've gained.
