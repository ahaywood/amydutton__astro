A lot of times, I get caught up in indecision. What stack? Which technology? There are so many languages, frameworks, and libraries to pick from! JavaScript, Rails, PHP, Python? [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Keystone.js](https://keystonejs.com/), [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)? [Sanity](https://sanity.io), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)?

If I'm starting a new project, then I want it to use the best technology, the right platform/framework, and a solution that’s going to last.

## If I were to start a new project right now, in 2023, what stack would I use?

Well, that depends... (The best developers know that the right answer is always, “It depends.”) **Here's a list of questions that I work through to determine what my starting point should be.**

1. What is the nature and purpose of the project?
2. What are the scalability and performance requirements?
3. What are the existing infrastructure and technologies in use within the organization?
4. What is the expected timeline and budget for the project?
5. What are the skills and expertise of the development team?
6. What are the long-term maintenance and support considerations?
7. What are the security and compliance requirements?
8. What are the integration needs with external systems or services?
9. Are there any specific industry standards or regulations to comply with?
10. What are the target platforms or devices for the project?
11. What are the preferred programming languages and frameworks within the development team?
12. What is the availability of resources, documentation, and community support for the chosen technologies?
13. What are the future growth plans and potential changes in requirements?
14. Are there any specific design or user experience considerations?

The solution might not always be obvious, but the answers to these questions help narrow down the options.
