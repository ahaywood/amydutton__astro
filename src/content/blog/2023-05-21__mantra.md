Over the past 44 days, I've posted an Atomic Essay every day. I also have a podcast ([Compressed.fm](https://compressed.fm)) and a [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/selfteacme). I've dabbled in live streaming on Twitch and writing longer-form content on Hashnode.

**But it's all an experiment.**

Algorithms change. The "growth hacks" that worked a year ago no longer yield the same results. Engagement feels different. Interests have changed.

To stay current, you have to be willing to try new things constantly. I've found calling it an experiment gives me the freedom to do things differently than I've done before. It makes it OK to fail or get different results. By calling it an experiment, I can give myself permission.
