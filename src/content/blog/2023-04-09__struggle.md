Everyone carries something.

Some burdens we pick up. Others are handed to us.

Regardless, we get to decide _how_ we're going to carry it.

Let me give a practical example:
After giving birth to 3 children, I have a mom bod. I think about it more than I should. It bothers me. It's something I struggle with.

My sister, on the other hand, works out every.single.day. She has to get up at 4:00am every day to exercise. She sweats through the pain and pushes herself daily to stay in shape. It's exhausting. This is her struggle.

We both carry something. We both struggle in our own way. But, we get to pick that struggle. We get to pick the pain that we want to bear.

This applies to other areas of life. Take tech. It's hard to learn how to code and break into the industry. A lot of people get frustrated with the learning process and eventually give up. Tackling anything new is uncomfortable. It's a struggle. You have to ask yourself: am I willing to carry this burden? Am I going to stick with it? Ultimately, only you can answer that for yourself. When you say can't do it, are you really saying you won't do it? Is the payoff worth fighting for? What struggle do you want to carry?
