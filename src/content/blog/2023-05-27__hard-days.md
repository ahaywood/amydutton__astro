I've been writing Atomic Essays for the past 49 days. Honestly, it's harder now than it was at the beginning.

- It's hard when you don't see the results and the engagement you hoped for.
- It's hard when to continue to come up with topics that are interesting and exciting.
- It's hard to be disciplined and stay motivated over the long haul. In the beginning, it's new and interesting, but over time it feels harder and more difficult.

Even though it can feel like a struggle, deep down, I know that it's the hard days where character is built. The difficulty provides an opportunity for growth. It's how I respond in the hard moments that define me as a content creator.

So, I'll continue to push forward.
