I have been doing web design and development for more than 22 years. It's been part of my life longer than it hasn't.

## Here's how I first got interested in building websites:

In 8th grade, my grade took a class trip to Washington, DC. That same year, the band went to Disney World. My parents told me I couldn't do both. I had to pick one.

This is not a hard decision for any 14-year-old. Disney World, obviously!

While the rest of my grade was learning about our country's history, I spent the week in the computer lab building my first website in Netscape Navigator's Building Tools. I decided to take all the animated gifts online and put them on a single website. Let's just say I was ahead of my time. No-code and Gify in the 90s!

I was hooked. I loved the art. I loved the freedom and accessibility of it. Me, a fourteen-year-old, could post something for the entire world to see.

A lot of things have changed since then, but my love for the craft hasn't.

## My goal over the next second half of my career is:

- Helping other people learn the craft and build businesses online, the same way I have.
