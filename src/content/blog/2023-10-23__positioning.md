A lot of SaaS founders underestimate the value of product market fit. They've built a great application but aren't seeing the response and growth they want/need.

You don't need to change your product, but rather who you're marketing it to and the problem you're trying to solve (positioning). There are several examples throughout history where a slight shift makes all the difference:

- **Play-Doh** was first manufactured in the 1930s as a wallpaper cleaner. Then, in the mid-1950, it was reworked and marketed to Cincinnati schools a an education convention.

- **Bubble Wrap** was invented in 1957 and originally marketed as wallpaper(!!) In 1967, people realized its usefulness as a protective covering.

- **Post-It Notes** was invented by Spencer Silver, who was trying to create a stronger adhesive for the aerospace industry but was only able to create a weak adhesive that didn't leave any residue. Six years later, a colleague realized the perfect use case for bookmarks and writing notes.

**Don't underestimate the value of knowing your customers.**
