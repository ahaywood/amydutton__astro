I've worked on projects before where the roles aren't clear. This makes progress difficult. There should be clarity not only around the work but also about who's responsible.

Recently, a project manager on my team introduced me to the RACI matrix, which outlines 4 different roles that ensure everything that needs to be done on a project is appropriately assigned.

## 1 // Responsible

The responsible people are the stakeholders that are responsible for doing the work. They are responsible for the decisions and ensuring that the work gets done.

## 2 // Accountable

The accountable person is the project owner. They have to sign off and make approvals.

## 3 // Consulted

The consulted person should provide input before the work is done. They need to "stay in the loop" and know what's happening.

## 4 // Informed

The informed person receives updates on progress and decisions. But, they do not contribute directly and are not consulted.
