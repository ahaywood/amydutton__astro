In April, I participated in [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/) and wrote 100-300 words (an Atomic Essay) every day for 30 days. Afterward, I decided that I wanted to maintain my writing habit. I did great for 74 days.

Then, yesterday, I broke my streak. I wish I had a good reason or at the very least could say "Life got in the way." But, it didn't. It was a choice I made. Simply put, I didn't want to. I put it off all day and then just didn't.

Here's the thing, though. I've felt terrible about it all day. Yesterday, I could have done the "hard" thing for 30 minutes and written the post. Instead, I opted to de-prioritize writing and exchanged 30 minutes of writing struggle for 24 hours of disappointment in myself.

I know. It's not the end of the world and I can have grace for myself. But, there's also a lesson here. I would rather have short-term pain for long-term gain. Short-term "gain" is not worth the long-term pain.
