A holotype is a scientific term. When scientists discover a new species, they use something called a holotype as a reference point. It serves as a blueprint for that particular species. We can create similar reference points for different types of websites or applications:

1. **Social Networking** - This is like LinkedIn or Facebook. It's all about networking and connecting people.
2. **Social Media** - Think YouTube and Instagram. You're sharing media.
3. **eCommerce** - Shopify or WooCommerce, with the ability to search, accept payments, cart, checkout (including drop off), and SEO.
4. **Content** - Any blog or news site qualifies. It's not just about delivery but also about ease of use and reducing the friction of publishing
5. **Personal Information** - think Gmail/Outlook or Google Calendar. This includes rich text editing, embedded content, offline & sync, and notifications.
6. **Productivity** - Google Docs and Dropbox, with storage, rich text editing, filesystem, offline & sync
7. **Media Players** - Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Spotify, and Pandora. These apps include infinite scrolling, filtering and sorting, notifications, offline, and are embeddable.
8. **Graphical Editor** - Figma is the first application that comes to mind. This includes GPU, image manipulation, and filesystem considerations.
9. **Media Editor** - These are apps allow you to edit audio or video. This includes audio processing, device integration, storage, offline, and filesystem considerations.
10. **Engineering Tool** - This includes Code Sandbox, GitPod, Code Spaces, and StackBlitz. Considerations include filesystem, storage, offline, and embedded content.
11. **Immersive Games** - The biggest concerns are 3D Rendering, GPU, audio capture, and device integration (game pad).
12. **Casual Games** - This includes 2D and 3D rendering, GPU, embeddable, and audio processing.

Of course, different holotypes require different technologies, but it helps solve problems by grouping applications into these 12 buckets.
