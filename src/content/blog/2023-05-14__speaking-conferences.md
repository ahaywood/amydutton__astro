Last year, I had the pleasure of speaking at 5 different conferences around the world. I received incredible insight into what companies are doing. I made friendships and memories that will last a lifetime.

Maybe this sounds intriguing to you. So, where do you start?

**Every conference has a CFP process.** CFP stands for Call for Proposals or Call of Papers. This is your invitation to submit your talk idea. The qualifications and requirements will vary.

It's fascinating how many CFPs are submitted and what the selection process looks like. Therefore, a lot of event organizers will use a service like [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/) to manage the process.

In fact, if you're looking for somewhere to start, I'd start there: **Create an account on Sessionize and fill in your profile information.** Then, Sessionize will match you with events that correspond to keywords in your profile.

Within Sessionize, you can also write a single abstract and submit it to multiple conferences. This makes the submission process seamless.

If you have trouble deciding what to submit, **go back and look at the event's archives. See what kind of talks have been accepted in the past.** Watch conference talks on YouTube. Which ones are your favorite? Do they have something in common? If you find it interesting, most likely, other people will too.

**Find the event organizer's contact information and reach out to them directly.** Ask questions. Find out more information about their audience. What kinds of talks are they looking for? They want their event to be a success, so they're usually more than happy to help.

**Don't forget, you have a message to share, in a way that's unique to you.**
