I’ve been thinking about my 2024 goals since October. I started looking at all the goals I knew I wouldn't finish in ‘23 and envisioning how ‘24 would be different. The problem is that 2023 started the same way. Most of my goals were carried over from 2022.

So I’ve started asking myself: what changed? I start each year with the best intentions but there’s a misalignment with between my annual planning and my day-to-day actions.

Which begs the question: What is the end-goal of a goal? Bragging rights? Vanity metrics?

Additionally, with every yes there are even more noes. If I want to succeed, I need to be just as intentional with my yeses and as my noes. This year, in addition to my list of goals that I will do, I'm also making a list of goals I won't do.
