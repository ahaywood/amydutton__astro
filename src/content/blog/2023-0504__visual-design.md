I get asked all the time, "How do I become better at visual design? If I don't have a design system to work with, how do I get better at starting from scratch?"

That's hard. Right?! Starting with nothing and creating something.

It's easy to think, "You either have it or you don't." But the answer is a cop-out. We all started somewhere! I'm embarrassed to show you some of my early work. (My family still gives me a hard time about my Comic Sans phase. üò©)

Unfortunately, there's not a book, blog post, YouTube video, podcast, or course that I can point to and say "Watch this and everything will suddenly click." There's not a magical switch. **It comes in the doing and putting in the reps.** And that's the way it is with most things in life, right? Playing an instrument. Sports. Learning a foreign language.

As you put in the hours, you'll figure out a system that works for you. You'll gain confidence. You'll get there.

I still meet with clients or get handed assignments and think, ‚ÄúOh man, I have no idea what the end product is going to look like or how we're going to get there.‚Äù

But, I have confidence that the journey is going to be great, and follow that thought with, ‚ÄúThe end result is going to be amazing. I can't wait to see where we land.‚Äù
