One of my favorite tools for front-end development is Storybook.

Storybook is an interface that makes it easy to create an organized UI system. It streamlines the building process and creates a living document for all the components within your application.

Storybook makes it easy to build your components in isolation. When I've worked on projects without Storybook, I've been forced to create "dummy" pages that need to be removed from the final codebase so that I can see what I'm building within the browser. This workflow also makes it easy for the frontend team to build the design system, allowing backend developers to focus on the functionality.

Once your component library is built within Storybook, you can see all your project's components at a glance. Each component is documented, outlining all the props that can be passed in.

Storybook also supports accessibility and visual regression testing directly within its interface.

Whenever I start a new project, Storybook is one of the first tools that I install because it's become an integral step in my development workflow.
