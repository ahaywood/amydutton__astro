Whenever I take the time to pause and think about it, I'm so grateful to be in tech.

I look around, and there are so many new things that are happening in the industry. There's so much to be excited about. I've been building websites for 22 years. A lot has changed during that time. Browsers are supporting more and more features. The CSS spec continues to expand. JavaScript is growing, with the ability to control things on the front and back end. We have so many tools at our disposal. It's easier now than ever to build dynamic and engaging websites and applications.

There's a wealth of information and knowledge available online, where people genuinely want to share what they've learned and help others level up.

I don't know of any other industry that has the concept of open-source projects where there's a commitment to building and sharing.

With technology, there's so much potential to make a big difference in the world. With code, you can leverage a little to do a lot, solving some of the world's biggest problems at scale.

I'm so grateful that I get to be a part of it.
