In the past 22 years that I've been doing web development and design, CSS changed a lot. We have more methods and tools than ever for working with positions and layouts. But, with more options comes more complexity. Take Flexbox and CSS Grid, for example. They both have similar features. When should you reach for one or the other?

There are a couple of different ways you can think about this.

**If you’re moving in one direction, reach for Flexbox. If you’re moving in multiple directions, then reach for CSS Grid.**

The second way you can think about this: **Should the content inform the layout? Reach for Flexbox. Should the layout inform the content? Reach for CSS Grid.**

Let's consider a couple of examples:

Say we have a set of social media icons that should be aligned horizontally in the footer. We're moving in one direction (horizontally). That's a huge clue! But, also, the content (the social media icons) informs the layout. The space between each icon can be flexible and may change depending on how many icons we have.

Here's another example: we have a page layout with 3 columns. Here, content can be placed horizontally and vertically. There are three columns and an infinite number of rows. The layout informs where elements should be placed. CSS Grid provides the structure that we need.

As with most things in web development, there are always edge cases. But, maybe these guidelines will help provide a framework when you're deciding how to structure your CSS.
