## Sometimes it's advantageous to be first.

Within tech, it's helpful to be an early adopter. In the early 2000s Netflix started transitioning from a DVD rental service to a digital streaming platform. It recognized a shift in customer preference and positioned itself as a frontrunner in the streaming industry. The move allowed them to offer a vast library of content on-demand, disrupt the rental industry, and gain significant market share, fundamentally changing the entertainment industry.

## Sometimes second is the best.

Being first does not guarantee long-term success. It's more important to remain adaptable and continuously innovate. A prime example is the rise (and fall) of MySpace. This was the dominant social media platform. Despite its initial popularity, it failed to adapt to changing user preferences and capitalize on emerging trends. Facebook, although second, quickly became the best. It learned from MySpace's experiences and offered a better, more streamlined user experience.
