30 days ago, I signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

In that time, I wrote and published 30 Atomic Essays. ðŸŽ‰ It has been a very rewarding (and challenging) journey, and I am more excited than ever to keep writing online.

Here are the 3 biggest things writing and publishing consistently every day for 30 days taught me:

## 1. Atomic Essays are Gateway Habits

In Atomic Habits by James Clear, he talks about gateway habits -- These are habits that are small enough that they're easy to start. Then, once you start doing the thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. The following actions can be more challenging, but the initial steps should be easy. A gateway habit leads you down a more productive path.

Writing an Atomic Essay every day has become a gateway habit for me. I've been able to prove to myself that I can write every day. I can make time for the things that I prioritize. This has challenged me to consider other habits and goals I've set.

## 2. Everything is an Experiment

Ship30 encourages you to experiment. There's no need to develop a niche now or prejudge ideas. Publish it and see what resonates. Listen to the signals -- the likes, retweets, interactions, views, and engagements. Pay attention to feedback loops in order to determine where to double down.

## 3. Publishing is Better than Perfect

Multiple times, I would write a post and think, "I should edit this down." Or, "I'm not sure this idea is clear." Or, "I could have taken this post in a different direction." Don't let those hesitations hold you back. It's easy to overthink, but it's more important to publish.

If you have been thinking about getting started writing online too, let me know. I'm happy to share more about the experience and what I learned.
