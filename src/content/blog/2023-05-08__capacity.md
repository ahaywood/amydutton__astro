Time is normalizing. Everyone only has 24 hours in the day. It is our most valuable asset. No amount of money can buy you more time. **_BUT_ you can buy more capacity.**

Recently, I finished the book [_Buy Back Your Time_ by Dan Martell.](https://amzn.to/3xi4Xh5) It challenged my thinking about hiring.

As a business owner, maybe you can do everything, but you **_shouldn't_**. Think about all the tasks that are on your to-do list. Assign a dollar amount to each. Managing your calendar, scheduling meetings, and replying to emails is $15-20/hr work. Strategic thinking and planning out a company's next steps is $100-150/hr type of work. Why are you selling yourself and your company short? Not only are you wasting your most valuable asset (your time!), but you're thinking and acting small.

It's hard to let go. It feels good to be needed and do the work. But, **hire people you trust, and then trust them to do their job.**
