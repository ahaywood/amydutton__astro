One of the hardest parts about starting a new design is getting started and overcoming a blank canvas. An empty Figma document can be overwhelming.

Therefore, **Iâ€™ve developed a couple of tricks to help me build momentum.**

## ðŸ‘‰ Tip #1: Dump everything that you know you need into your project.

Instead of staring at a blank screen, there are a few elements you know you will need.

For example, every website or application has navigation. So, one of the first things I do is add text boxes for all the navigation elements.

Youâ€™ll need a footer with copyright information and links to legal policies. Add those.

Add the logo.

Once you have enough elements on the page, start putting them together. Then, it feels more like putting a puzzle together and less like creating something from absolutely nothing.

## ðŸ‘‰ Tip #2: Start with the easiest parts first.

It might make sense to start at the top of the page and work your way down. Or, start with the focal point or the most important element. But, sometimes those can pose mental hurdles, especially if youâ€™re still trying to develop design patterns for your project. Instead, start with the easiest element and go from there â€” a lot of times that means starting with the footer. Mainly because I know all the content that needs to be included and its relatively straightforward.

## With these 2 tricks, I can start building momentum, which makes it easier to tackle other elements on the page.
