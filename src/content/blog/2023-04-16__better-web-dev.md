Whether you're just getting started in technology or whether you've been doing this for decades 🙋‍♀️ the number 1 tip to get better:

## Start Building Things

👉 Whenever I'm working through a course or a tutorial, I always have a project in mind of how I want to apply the things that I'm learning. This moves me out of tutorial hell and helps me **apply the knowledge that I'm learning.**

👉 As you work on different projects, you'll encounter plenty of error messages and bugs. This might be frustrating at first, but it's actually a crucial part of the learning process. Reading and understanding error messages teaches you how to **identify problems in your code**, while debugging helps you develop problem-solving skills.

👉 **Fail fast.** When you're building things, you'll quickly learn what does and doesn't work. Experiment. Make mistakes – what matters most is that you keep building and learning.

👉 Some things can only be learned through experience. **The more you build, the more experience you acquire.**
