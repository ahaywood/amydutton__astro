I ran my own freelance company for almost 7 years. During that time, I did branding, print, web design, and development for a variety of clients.

I enjoyed the flexibility of freelance, but I quickly learned that freelance doesn't equal freedom. If I wasn't working, I wasn't getting paid. So, I worked all.the.time. The last family vacation we went on, I tried my best to be present. I'd go to the beach in the morning, play board games or pickle ball in the afternoon, and go out for ice cream in the evenings. But, as soon as everyone went to bed, I'd pull out my computer and put in 6-7 hours' worth of work. I'd go to bed around 4am and do it all over the next day. I came home from vacation more exhausted than when I left. I **didn't set boundaries.** I didn't tell clients, "No." It wasn't my client's fault. It was mine.

In my attempt to please people, I didn't take care of myself or our family. Setting boundaries means saying "no" to more than you say "yes." Ironically, this _gains_ more respect and allows you to truly excel in the tasks that you are committed to.
