**Content creation is hard.**

If the secret to success in content creation is consistency, then **the secret to consistency is discipline + systems.**

I started writing an "Atomic Essay" every day, 55 days ago. I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but this is the most consistent I've ever been. But, that success, in large part, is due to the systems that I now have in place:

- I have a running backlog of content ideas within Notion
- Every night, after the kids go to bed, I sit down at my laptop and write.
- I've been posting through a platform called "TypeShare," which will create an image of the content to post to Twitter. Then, it will cross post a text-only version to LinkedIn.
- The post doesn't have to be long, which makes it more approachable (and sustainable). It's also gotten easier over time.
- **I don't need to reinvent the wheel, but I do have to deliver.**

Within the past week, I've increased my posting cadence on Twitter. Again:

- Pulling from the backlog of content ideas in [Notion](https://notion.io)
- Within [Hypefury](https://hypefury.com/), I set up buckets of categories. Then, I set up a reoccurring calendar, scheduling each topic.
- Every day, I check the calendar to ensure the next day is accounted for.

Yes, it's work, but the backlog of content within Notion has provided a system and reduced the friction to getting started. I have a plan, which makes execution easier.
