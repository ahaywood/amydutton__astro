Recently, I started keeping a log of everything I do each day. This is as simple as a bulleted list within Notion. I don't provide any commentary or inject any emotion. It's simply a running list of facts. This is key because it makes it approachable and easy to maintain.

At the end of the day, this list makes it easy to report on and check in. For the days when I donâ€™t feel like I'm able to get a lot done, I can look at my log and see exactly where I spent my time. It provides a natural feedback loop to say, "No, I really was productive." Or reflect, "This is the thing that derailed me."

At the end of the week, I can also use this log to provide a weekly summary, updating the team on everything that was accomplished.
