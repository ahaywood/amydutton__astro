In the JavaScript ecosystem, it seems like a new framework crops up every week.

Itâ€™s hard to stay on top of the latest and greatest. And it can be even harder to make a decision about what technology stack to use. Paralysis by analysis.

To compare, I've started the same project on multiple frameworks, trying to find the perfect setup.

### Iâ€™ve discovered the secret:

## Be Boring

- **The tool you know is better than the tool you donâ€™t know.** Use the tool thatâ€™s going to allow you to move the fastest. Deliverability is key.
- **Reliability is more important than new.** You want an option thatâ€™s proven itself and proven the test of time.
- **Donâ€™t underestimate the value of the community.** When something happens (and it will), where can you go for help? Are there blog posts, YouTube Videos, Stack Overflow answers, Discord Servers, and forums that will help you overcome hurdles? All these serve as social proof.

In the end, make the decision and stand firm in it. Avoid shiny tool syndrome or FOMO. Boring is best.
