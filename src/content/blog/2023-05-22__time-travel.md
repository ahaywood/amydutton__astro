Recently, I finished the book [Hell Yeah or No by Derek Sivers](https://amzn.to/43HwqoC). In the book, Derek suggests that there are 2 types of people in the world: (1) those focused on the present and (2) those focused on the future.

**Present-focused thinkers are fully immersed in the current moment.** They appreciate the life and the people around them. They pursue pleasure, excitement, and new experiences.

**Future-focused thinkers are OK with delayed gratification.** They're self-disciplined because they understand the payoff in the future.

**You need both types of thinking.** You need to be present in the moment while understanding the consequences of your actions.

This mindset has challenged me. When my kids tell me about their day or we do something as a family, I want to be completely present. I want to soak it up and remember that this moment is fleeting.

When I'm undisciplined, I try to revisit my actions and ambitions through the lens of my future self. Am I being kind to my future self, setting her up for success?

Like most things in life, it's all a balance.
