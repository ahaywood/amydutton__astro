I've been doing web design and development since I was 16 years old. Yep! I'm one of _those_.

But there's no way I would be where I am without the help of others. It's true: it takes a village.

## Stephen Tallent

Stephen ran Tallent Communications, a local agency that designed and developed websites. I was looking for a summer job where I could gain some experience. I knew nothing, but he hired me anyway to answer the phone. Little did I know that this would set the trajectory for my entire career.

## Stephen Moseley

I may have been the receptionist that summer, but Stephen (a front-end developer at Tallent) believed in me. Toward the end of the summer, he handed me an HTML for Beginners book. Then, let me look over his shoulder while he coded a website from scratch, slicing mock-ups apart in Fireworks and reassembling them in HTML tables. Something clicked. I returned the following summer (and two more after that) as a front-end developer.

## Katherine Terrell

Even though I was doing front-end development, Katherine knew my heart was in design. As Tallent's Art Director, she suggested I create client mock-ups alongside her. She would design her comps, and I would design mine. Then, I would sit in critiques and get feedback on my work. If it were good enough, we'd show the client. Only a few mock-ups made it through the review process, but I was the biggest benefactor, walking away with expert feedback. She was always patient with me. I don't know very many people that been given that kind of opportunity as a high school student.

These three people have taught me so much. I'm forever grateful for their gifts of time, knowledge, and careâ€”and, similarly, I hope to pass along the same generosity.
