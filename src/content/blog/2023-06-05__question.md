I spend a lot of my time thinking about my "body of work."

But lately, one question I've been asking myself is this:

## What do I want to be known for?

In his book [The Practice](https://amzn.to/4azTHuQ), Seth Godin says you don't get to decide what that is. Your audience decides. It's your job to do the work and show up. That's what professionals do. We show up, regardless of how we feel about it. **Your audience decides what resonates with them.**

Part of me feels like that isn't fair. It's my identity. Why should they decide that for me? But the truth of the matter is that the things that I create aren't for me. They're for them. It's for you.

It's about feeling a void, a need, and alleviating pain. It's about serving and helping. So, I'll keep showing up.
