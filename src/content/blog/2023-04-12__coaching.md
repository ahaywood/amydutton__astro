There are a lot of business books available about management and communication. Most of them talk about the value of having a 1:1. But very few go into detail about what that looks like practically.

The best book on managing a team I've found is **[The Coaching Habit, Say Less, Ask More, and Change the Way You Lead Forever](https://amzn.to/3VI0zlx) by Michael Bungay Stanier.**

## For a few reasons:

- **Reason #1:** The book recommends specific questions to get to the root of what someone wants to discuss.
- **Reason #2:** There are additional questions for determining the next step and the best course of action.
- **Reason #3:** As a manager, it's not about me doing more work or saving the day, but supporting and empowering my team to do their best and enabling them to do the job they were hired to do.

Even if you're not leading 1:1s, this book is full of lessons in good communication and enriching the conversations with those around you. I can't recommend this book enough.

(And if you've read it, do you agree? What other book would you recommend for leading teams?)
