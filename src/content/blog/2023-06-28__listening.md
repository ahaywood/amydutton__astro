Anytime I think about my mortality, it's natural to shift to "How am I spending my time?" Hustle! Be productive! Get more done! We only have so much time!

**But, that's missing the point.** Being purposeful and intentional is different than doing. We try to conflate the two.

This week, we celebrated my grandmother's 103rd birthday. Today, we celebrate my son's 9th birthday. Even though they're separated by 94 years, they have a special bond. Isaac will sit with her and teach her about Pokemon and Among Us. I don't know how if she follows everything he says, but she'll still listen intently and ask him questions.

This is what it means to be intentional. As Isaac gets older, he might not remember these conversations like I do, but he will remember a great grandmother that not only loved him, but listened.

It's important to remember that one of the most intentional and purposeful things that we can do is to listen.
