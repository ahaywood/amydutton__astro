One of my favorite podcast interviews was with Josh Wardle, the creator of Wordle. ([Syntax.fm, Episode 430](https://syntax.fm/show/430/creator-of-wordle-josh-wardle)) Yes, the popular word game that the New York Times bought for seven figures.

Josh shared the game's origin story, as well as the technology behind it. One particular aspect of the game stuck with me: he called it "Juice." (Based on a talk posted on YouTube, called "Juice It or Lose It.")

Juice is all about providing feedback through the user interface.

In the game of Wordle, as soon as you hit enter, submitting your word, the program immediately knows which letters are right and wrong. But, the letters flip in slowly, revealing the result. The animation takes less than 1 second but adds "juice" to the game. This is satisfying because it mimics reality. In the real world, things don't happen simultaneously. By slowing down, the game feels more organic and human. This subtle treatment adds pop.

Since listening to this episode, I've been challenged to reconsider how I approach motion design, and how slowing elements down can be more satisfying.

In the comments, I'd love to hear other "juicy" examples you've encountered.
