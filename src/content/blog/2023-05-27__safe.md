In business, it's hard to de-risk. We can't see the future. How do you know ahead of time whether your idea will work or not? How do you know if it's worth your time and investment?

### If you want to make a safe bet, don't ask your customer.

Your customer might not know the answer.

> Some people say give the customers what they want, but that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd ask customers what they wanted, they would've told me a faster horse." People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page. ~ Steve Jobs

### Instead, observe your audience.

Your customer will be far more truthful "in the wild." You want to catch people in their "natural habitat" and not the zoo-based interaction. Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman have named this discovery process: "Sales Safari."

Find your audience's "watering holes." Determine where they're congregating online to talk about their emotions, pains, and recommendations.

By observing, you'll be able to see what language, or jargon, they use. This fuels your marketing language. You'll see first-hand what they need, not what they're asking for.
