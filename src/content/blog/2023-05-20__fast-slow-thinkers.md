> People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it's an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it's a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.

I think of myself as a slow thinker. I don’t have the wittiest comeback or the game-changing idea in a brainstorming session. But, just like a crock pot, I let the flavors come out over time. Problems marinate and tenderize.

When you’re trying to work on a project as a group, it’s easy to defer to the fast thinkers and allow them to drive the decisions. But, it’s important that slow thinkers have the time they need to process. If you arrive at a decision as a group, revisit that decision. Does the decision still stand in 5 hours? 5 days? 5 weeks? 5 months?
