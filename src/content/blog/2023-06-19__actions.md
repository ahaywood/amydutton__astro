> No matter what you say, your actions reveal the truth.

I think about this a lot.

I think about this when my kids ask me to eat lunch with them at school. Or, when I’m walking the dogs or taking out the trash. These seem like trivial chores. But, I know they communicate so much more to my husband and my kids.

I think about this when I don’t prioritize my health. I skip a workout or don’t eat the healthiest food.

I think about this when I’m obsessing over a creative problem and struggle to be fully present.

I try to be intentional about the the type of person I am and the character I’m building. But, I know it’s essential that my actions are aligned.
