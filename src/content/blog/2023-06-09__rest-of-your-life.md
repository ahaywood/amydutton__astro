I remember being fresh out of college and struggling to determine what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

I had spent summers working at a web agency, designing and developing web sites. I loved it.

My major was in Radio/TV Broadcasting, with a concentration in animation. I wanted to work for Disney or Pixar as a 3D animator. This was a dream I'd had since I was 10 years old. Changing directions felt like I was giving up on myself and my dream.

As I weighed my options, I came to realize that I didn't need to worry about deciding what I would do for the rest of my life. People change. Technology changes. That's undue pressure that you're putting on yourself. You can always change your mind and change your course. **My advice is to do the next right thing. That's it. Take the next step directly in front of you.**
