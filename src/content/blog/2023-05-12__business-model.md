If you want to make money online, there are 3 main business models. Each comes with its own pros and cons.

## Product

### 👍 Pros

- You're in charge. You get to drive the product, make decisions, and create a roadmap.
- You can focus on making one thing great.
- If one customer leaves, the impact on your business is minimal.

### 👎 Cons

- You have to find product-market fit and find hundreds of customers in order to be profitable.
- You have hundreds or thousands of customers all with opinions and various use cases that you have to take into consideration.
- It's easy to get stuck in a rut because you're focused on one product and its technology.

## Client Services

### 👍 Pros

- You only have to find 1 or 2 customers in order to be profitable.
- This is the easiest and fastest way to make money online.
- You get to work on a variety of projects.

### 👎 Cons:

- You're beholden to stakeholders. You can make recommendations, but at the final decision is not yours.
- With fewer clients, churn can be painful.

## Content / Education

You could break this down even further:

## Selling to Individual Users

_In a lot of ways, this is similar to selling product, where your content is the product._

### 👍 Pros

- You're able to build your brand instead of someone else's.

### 👎 Cons

- You have to "feed the beast" -- in order to stay relevant you to have be consistent and disciplined to create content each week.

## Selling Sponsorships

_This model is similar to client services. Fewer "customers", with more money._

### 👍 Pros

- A sponsorship can help offset the up front costs.

### 👎 Cons

- The company you're working with can feel entitled and want a say in the content and its delivery. Naturally, they want to be represented well.
- Your brand is tied to the company that you're partnering with. (This could be considered a good or a bad thing. If its a well known company it can bring trust, authority, and recognition. However, if the company does something you disapprove of, you could be associated by proximity.)

People say, "The grass is always greener on the other side." But, I prefer, "The grass is greener where you water it." Regardless of what your pricing model is there will always be positives and negatives. You have to pick which battle you want to fight in.
