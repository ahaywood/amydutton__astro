I ran my own business full-time for seven years. During that time, I experimented with several pricing models to find something that worked best for me and my clients.

## Option #1: Hourly Rate

With an hourly rate, you're exchanging your time for money.

### When this works well:

- You don't know the entire scope of the project or how long it will take you.
- The client is prone to scope creep.

### The problem with hourly rates:

- The more expertise you gain, the faster you become. But, the task becomes cheaper because you're better.
- Clients will nickel and dime. "Did it really take you that long?"
- There's a cap on the amount clients are willing to pay for your time. They're assessing the value of your time versus the value of the project.
- It's hard for clients to budget. No one knows the total amount until the project is finished and the final invoice is submitted.
- If you're not working, you're not getting paid, making it difficult to take time off.

## Option #2: Project-Based Rate

With a project-based rate, you and your client agree from the beginning the scope of work and the total budget.

### When this works well:

- The project's scope is well-defined.
- You can charge more for a project, without the client wondering how you spent your time.
- You can charge more for your experience.

### The problem with project-based rates:

- If the scope of the project increases, then you have to be diligent about issuing a change request. This can create additional negotiations mid-project.
- It discourages iteration, even helpful and purposeful change.

## Option #3: Value-Based Pricing

With value-based pricing, you charge for the value that you're bringing to the project. For example, if your project saves a company $1m and you charge 10%, you get $100k.

### When this works well:

- Both you and your client can win big.
- There's additional incentives because you have vested interest.
- You're an expert and you're truly charging for your expertise.
- You need flexibility within your pricing structure. You can negotiate equity and tiered pricing.

### The problem with value-based rates:

- It's hard to determine value, especially up front.
- It's difficult to know ahead of time the impact your project will have.

These are the 3 main options, but you can always mix and match in a way that makes sense for both you and your clients.
