If you are at all interested in product -- design, development, or product management -- then you need to check out [Lenny's Newsletter on Substack](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/). (Disclaimer: it's a paid newsletter $15/mo, but well worth the investment)

And here's why:

- Lenny was a product lead for 7 years at AirBnB and has extensive experience building product
- He has an extensive network, interviewing people from [Notion](https://notion.io), [Ramp](https://ramp.com), [Miro](https://miro.com), [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/), and [Coda](https://coda.io/) (just to name a few) and how each of these companies build product. -- There is no one size fits all method, and there are lessons to be learned from each.
- There are plenty of resources and templates that you can swipe and repurpose

Honestly, Lenny's content is changing the way that I think about products, workflow, marketing, and growth.
