A project lives and dies by its documentation. If people don’t know how to use it, they won’t. So, then the question becomes how do you write good documentation?

[Divio has a great documentation framework](https://documentation.divio.com/) that creates 4 buckets:

## Tutorials

A tutorial is written from a teacher’s perspective, teaching a student what they want them to learn.

People learn best by doing. Create the smallest lesson where they can quickly accomplish something.

In a tutorial, T here’s no need to go into great detail or demonstrate all the options at their disposal. We’re looking for quick wins to get someone up and running as fast as possible.

## How To Guides

In this case, the user has a specific goal in mind and it’s our job to help them get there. In this case, they should already have foundational knowledge, but want to accomplish the task at hand quickly. Be direct and to the point.

## Reference

The reference material lays out the details for an API. It’s more technical in nature and explains the parameters and use cases.

## Background and Context

With background and context, you’re not trying to accomplish anything specific. Instead, you’re supplying information about why certain decisions were made and any context someone might need.

**All four types of documentation are needed for a project to find it’s true potential and succeed.**
