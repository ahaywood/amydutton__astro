Job titles are a funny thing. We associate ourselves and our identity with our job titles. "This is who I am."

But, the purpose of a title is to quickly communicate

1. **to people within your industry** what you do
2. **to the "outside world"** what you do

Unfortunately, there are several problems:

1. **We all operate under different definitions.**

- When one of my friends changed jobs, they lost the title "Senior." They didn't lose their skills overnight. Their new company defined the roles and levels of software engineers differently.

2. **Job titles don't reflect all the work we do. They are limited in scope.**

- We are multi-faceted human beings. A single label is a narrow explanation that doesn't reflect my full skill set or potential.
- My title at ZEAL is Director of Design. It completely ignores the fact that I'm also a Senior Full-Stack engineer.

3. **Job titles lack clarity.**

- Within the leadership team at work, we have intentional conversations about who's Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. Job titles alone can't provide that type of information.

To be honest, I don't know what the answer is. We can't just get rid of them, but, we can't place our entire identity on them either.

What do you think? How important is your job title to you?
