This is one of the lessons that I'm trying to teach my kids. But, I know, when I'm telling them, "You can do hard things." I'm telling myself too.

Yes, it might be painful in the short term, but doing hard things makes us a better version of ourselves in the long term. It makes the achievement greater and sweeter because you know the cost that comes with it.

> Whenever I say "I can't," most of the time what I really mean is "I won't." I don't want to.

> Often, when we use the word "can't," we start to behave like victims - powerless again our circumstances. It's as though we have no control over our time, energy, or choices. We take no responsibility for our lives.

> When you use the word "won't," you feel and behave more powerfully. You remember you're in charge of your thoughts and actions. YOU get to determine how to spend your time and your resources.

Whenever I'm in a tough situation, I ask myself, "Am I saying "I can't" or "I won't"?" This helps put things into perspective because I can do what I put my mind to. I shouldn't let difficulties stop me, but double down. Anything worth doing is hard. And I can do hard things.
