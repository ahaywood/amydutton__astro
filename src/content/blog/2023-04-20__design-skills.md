I always get asked: "How do I become a better designer?"

## Find work you like and make a note of why you like it.

What do you like about it? What makes it work? Is it the color palette? The typography? The style? Why does it resonate with you? What don't you like? What would you change?

By analyzing one piece at a time, we can gain insights into the components that make up the greater whole. This requires critical thinking skills and gives us a better understanding of the structure, purpose, and underlying principles of the design.

## Once you can do this with other people's work, it becomes much easier to do with your own work.

By breaking down each component of the design, we can determine which aspects are successful and which ones require more attention. Not only does this help us identify flaws, but it also provides a clear path for creating solutions.
