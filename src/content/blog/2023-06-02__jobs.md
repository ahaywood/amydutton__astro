This post is bittersweet.

This week I changed jobs. For the past 7.5 years, I’ve worked at ZEAL, first as a contractor, then as a Senior UI/UX designer and Frontend Developer, and the last 1.5 years as the Director of Design.

As I thought about change, I thought a lot about the skills I want to learn. How do I want to grow? If you’re a junior looking for your first job. That’s the advice I’d give you. Don’t look for the most prestigious company. It doesn't have to be a FAANG or the hottest startup. But, it does need to be somewhere that fosters learning, that teaches you the skills you need for the next phase in your journey. Even as someone that’s been in tech for 22 years, that's what I still look for.

What's my long-term goal? I've never been good at answering the question: "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" I still don't know the answer to that. But I do know two steps ahead. So, if the one step in between gets me closer and sets me on the right trajectory, I'll take that one step.

For the next step in my journey, I'll be joining the Redwood Core Team as a Lead Maintainer. I couldn't be more excited about this new adventure and what this might lead to, 2 steps, 5 steps, or 10 years down the line.
