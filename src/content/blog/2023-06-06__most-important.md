Retrospectives are crucial in any project or team setting as they provide an opportunity to reflect on past experiences, identify what went well, and uncover areas for improvement. This helps teams enhance their collaboration, learn from mistakes, and continuously evolve their processes, leading to better outcomes and growth over time.

There are a few frameworks that you can work with:

- I Liked, I Wish, I Wonder
- Start, Stop, Continue
- Mad, Sad, Glad
- Sailboat: Wind (Helped us move forward), Sun (Made us feel good), Anchor (held us back), Reef (future risk ahead)
- Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for

Regardless of what framework you use, the key is reflection and communication. Things won't get better or change over time unless they're acknowledged and addressed.
