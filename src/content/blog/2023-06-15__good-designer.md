There's a saying, "Your best camera is the camera you have on you." The same is true for design. The best tools are the ones you have. Yes, I have preferred tools and favorites, but I don't need any of them to design something great.

Young designers worry about the tools. Maybe they feel validated by the tools? Or, assume the tools will make their work better? But, **it's not the tool that makes the designer. It's their eye, their attention to detail, and their craft.**

I've designed in Microsoft Office, Powerpoint, and Keynote.

When I did a lot of print work, my favorite tools were my sketchbook, a pencil, and tracing paper. Forget the computer altogether!

It doesn't have to be anything fancy. Be willing to go back to the basics.
