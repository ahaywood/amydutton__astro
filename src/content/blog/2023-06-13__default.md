It's easy to go with the flow. Accepting things as they happen. But you may end up somewhere you never intended to be. It's like getting on the road and driving, with no destination in mind, just driving. The idea sounds absurd, but many do just that regarding their character.

I've written down a few principles that I consider to be my Guiding Principles. These are important to me and describe the person I want to become and what I want to be known. It's not an easy checklist. It requires work and effort.

From there, I've created goals that reinforce my principles. If these Guiding Principles truly guide my life, then they should also inform my behavior, habits, and routines.

What are the things in your life that are _that_ important to you?
