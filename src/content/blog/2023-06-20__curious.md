I started rewatching Ted Lasso. There are so many great one-liners. One of my favorites is in season one: **“Be curious, not judgmental.”**

This quote challenges me on a daily basis namely because it has so many applications.

I’d argue that so many of the coding techniques and patterns that are currently trending happened because someone was curious and challenged the status quo.

## Tailwind.

What happens if we forget about how many class names we apply to a tag? What if we approach styles based on utility?

## Single Page Applications

Caching on the server is hard. What if we push everything to the client and run as much as possible within the browser?

## Server Side Rendering

If everything runs in the browser, it makes it difficult to generate tags for SEO. Certain tasks are better handled on the server.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Challenge normal (whatever that is).
