I used to think that user personas were a waste of time. After all, you're talking about a fake person for a real product.

But, **the truth is that these fictitious people are foundational to how you build and market your product or service.**

- If you don't know your target buyer, then you don't know their pain points, and you don't know how to solve it. -- You can't emphasize with someone you don't know.
- Once you know where your target audience is spending their time, it makes it easier to market in the right places, using the same language your audience does.
- Your product / app / service can't be for everyone. If it tries to be, it's for no one.
- Personas provide a common language across teams, providing focus and ensuring everyone works together to solve the same problems.

Personas only "work" if you give them the proper attention and priority they deserve.
