I was listening to [episode #151 of the Creator Science podcast](https://podcast.creatorscience.com/nathan-barry-2/), where Jay Clouse interviews Nathan Barry, the Founder of ConvertKit. In the episode, Nathan explains what a flywheel is. Before, I knew it was a wheel that would spin faster and faster, but I didn't truly understand its purpose or how it worked.

Think of a well with a pump. It produces the same amount of water each time you pump it up and down. It requires the same effort, energy, and exertion each time you use it. It's not scalable. It's work.

However, you can take the same well and put a flywheel on top. When the wheel turns, it pumps the water. The first revolution is difficult and hard. But with each iteration, it gets easier as it builds momentum, feeding itself.

There are three rules of a flywheel:

1. The individual activities feed into the other in a circular motion.
2. Every rotation should be easier than the previous rotation.
3. Each rotation should produce more than the previous rotation.

Simple rules, but once applied all together, the results are incredible.

Apply this metaphor to your business. What are things you can do to make it easier on yourself, producing bigger and better results with each revolution?
