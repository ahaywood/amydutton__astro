One of my first jobs after college was on Music Row in Nashville, TN. We built websites for artists and entertainers.

The company I worked for developed a set of proprietary tools to offer musicians standard website features, such as music players and photo galleries. Surprisingly, during that time, these kinds of tools were not easily accessible. WordPress was not as popular as it is now and was only used as a blogging platform.

When I started, there was no documentation, so, that became part of my job description.

I had to shadow a co-worker anytime I needed to build a new feature. He'd explain their custom tagging structure, gotchas, and tips and tricks.

I took detailed notes and, at the end of each day, would write down everything I learned. My notes helped solidify my knowledge.

For every task, I was able to explain hat I did, why I did it, and how to repeat it in the future.

Even when I was experimenting, I'd write down each step, so that I could explain what I tried, what worked, and what didn't.

There's no better way to learn something than to write it down. Putting pen to paper (or pixels to screen) forces you to stop and think through its nuances that you might not have considered otherwise.

I quickly discovered: **for any job, notes are your most valuable asset.**

You don't truly understand a topic unless you're able to teach it and explain it.

**This is what building expertise looks like.**

And the conclusion to the story? The docs that I wrote became the training material for any new hire, and within a couple of months, I was considered a team lead. I knew their proprietary tools inside and out. After all, I had the documentation to prove it!
