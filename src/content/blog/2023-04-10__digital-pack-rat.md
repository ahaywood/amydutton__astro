If you want to become a better designer, start collecting things. **Look at the work you admire and identify what you like about it. Name it.**

Early in my career, I would spend the first hour of every workday doing "visual research." I'd go through galleries, award sites, books and magazines(!!), and anything I could get my hands on.

I took screenshots of everything and made meticulous notes in Evernote. (Today, I use Notion).

Why?

> "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something." -Steve Jobs, Wired Magazine 1995

The more extensive the collection, the more possible connection points for potential ideas.

The old adage applies: "Garbage in, garbage out." -- Except in reverse. I want to make sure I'm filling my collection with great things so that I'm able to produce great things.
