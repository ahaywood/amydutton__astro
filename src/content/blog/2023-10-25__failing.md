Let's be honest. No one likes failing. It's embarrassing and painful.

You can look at Facebook's motto, "Move Fast and Break Things," and think, "That sounds nice." But, the reality of that statement is scary. Just look around at the things we blame Mark Zuckerberg for breaking.

When my head hits the pillow at night, I don't count successes, I replay conversations and events (_/*ahem/*_ _failures_). What could I have done differently?

This mind trap is futile. There's a reason why we have the saying, "Hindsight is 20/20." Perfect decisions don't exist. We can only do the best we can with the information we have.

Recently, I've been reading (and listening) a lot about failure.

- 90% of startups in the United States fail, but we continue to lead the world in innovation.
- Thomas Edison had 1,000 unsuccessful attempts before he created the first light bulb.

We need to reframe our relationship with failure. It's simply feedback. Feedback gives us the knowledge we need to make better decisions and be successful in the future.

Embrace feedback and experimentation. Don't fear it. Lean into it. Use it to your advantage.
