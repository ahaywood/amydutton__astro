I've never considered myself a writer. It's always been a struggle for me. I might be proud of the result, but I hate the process. In college, I danced in my English professor's office as I turned in my final paper, satisfying my requirements to graduate.

As I've gotten older, I've realized that writing and communicating well are two of the most valuable skills you can bring to any profession. The two go hand-in-hand. If you want to become a better communicator, write. If you want to become a better writer, communicate.

For someone so ready to be done with English classes and writing, it's a skill I'm constantly trying to hone and get better at. I've read books and taken courses. Heck, I'm here, doing @ship30for30 and writing a 200-300 word Atomic Essay for 30 days!

The best piece of advice I've been given is:

## "Writers write."

This sounds overly simplistic. But it's true. How do I talk about myself? or view me? Each day I write is a vote saying, "Yes, I am a writer." With practice, I will get better. Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours, and each day I put in the time is one more hour down.
