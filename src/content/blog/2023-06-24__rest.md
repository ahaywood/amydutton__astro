I struggle with rest. I’m worse than a two-year. Sleeping feels like such a waste of time. I don’t feel like I’m doing anything when I sleep. But, in reality, sometimes it’s the most productive and creative thing you can do.

Science proves that during sleep, the brain consolidates new information, strengthening neural connections that form our memories and skills. Resting provides a vital pause for the brain, allowing subconscious processing of ideas, fostering innovation, and facilitating insightful problem-solving. As our minds drift in and out of sleep stages, our brain explores different connections and possibilities, often resulting in fresh perspectives and new ideas.

So the next time you feel stuck, stressed, or on the verge of burnout, give yourself permission to walk away from the screen. Give yourself the gift of rest.
