If you are at all interested in creating content, then you need to prioritize this article:

## How to become a professional creator – the PARTS model by Jay Clouse

And here's why:

- **Reason #1: As the title suggests, Jay outlines the PARTS model (Purpose, Attention, Revenue Model, Trust, and Systems).** This model includes all the components needed to create a successful content business. He also includes various questions you’ll need to think through and answer for yourself
- **Reason #2: Jay believes that becoming a professional content creator is a science not an art.**
  - I love this perspective because it says that anyone can become a content creator. Everyone has something to offer.
  - A lot of times we want to believe it’s an art, mixed with some luck. And while this may have some validity, this perspective allows us to excuse ourselves from putting in the time, discipline, hard work, and effort to make it happen.
- **Reason #3: Jay speaks from experience and authority.** He has interviewed hundreds of content creators and worked alongside legends within the industry. His perspective has been validated by many others that have “made it.”

This blog post has given me a lot of think through in how I want to approach my own presence online.
