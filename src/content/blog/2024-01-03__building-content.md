I find that I go through waves of building versus creating content, oscillating between the two. It's hard to do both simultaneously. -- or rather, hard to do both well.

When I'm building, I can focus on designing, coding, learning, and growing.

When I'm creating content, I'm sharing what I learned -- the missteps, the failures, the successes, and shortcuts.

The two phases go hand-in-hand. The building feeds content creation.

The problem is that if you want to do anything worthwhile, it takes time. It takes time to build something worth sharing, something that you're genuinely proud of. So, give yourself time and permission to do one or the other.
