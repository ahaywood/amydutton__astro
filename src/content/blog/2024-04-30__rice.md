Prioritization is hard. That's why you'll find dozens of frameworks and formulas and hundreds of productivity books that try to simplify the process.

## It's not just about working hard and efficiently. Prioritization ensures you're focusing on the right thing at the right time.

The team at Intercom created the RICE formula to help determine what to build next. The beauty of this formula is that it can be used to prioritize small tasks, like features, or larger undertakings, like projects.

## R is for Reach: How many people will this project affect within a given time frame (usually a month)?

A few examples:

- How many customers made it through the sales funnel?
- How many customers would use this feature?
- Increase the number of transactions?

It's also important to note if this is a one-time number or ongoing.

## I is for Impact: How much impact will this have on an individual user?

Or, when I'm gauging internal projects, how much impact will this project have on my business?

Impact is hard to quantify, but think of it on a scale of 0 - 3.

- 3 maximum
- 2 high
- 1 medium
- 0.5 low
- 0.25 minimal

## C is for Confidence: What is your level of confidence in these estimates?

This score takes uncertainty into consideration. It's a gamble and nothing is guaranteed.

This is measured in percentages:

- 100% high confidence
- 80% medium
- 50% low
- If it's below 50%, ask yourself if it's really worth doing.

## E is for Effort: How much time needs to be invested?

This should be calculated in "person-months." Use whole numbers.

Once numbers have been assigned, use the following formula to rank each project:

After applying this formula, I was amazed by the results. It enabled me to look at my work objectively, instead of giving projects weight based on my own feelings or excitement.
