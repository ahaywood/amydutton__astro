Today, there is an app, website, or software platform for just about anything. But, there's 1 app I can't live without:

## Notion

And here's why:

**Reason #1: I manage all my tasks, here.** David Allen wrote the popular productivity book Getting Things Done. One of my biggest takeaways from that book was getting tasks out of your head and into a system you trust, increasing your mental capacity to be creative and solve problems. My system is in Notion.

**Reason #2: I have a list of all my projects.** All tasks are tied to a project. I can include tasks alongside project documentation and share projects with other people (including clients!).

**Reason #3: I use the mobile app to collect ideas on the go.** I have a Notion widget on my iPhone that makes it easy to collect ideas when I'm away from my computer. I don't have to use a separate app or worry about migrating data or keeping it in sync. Information is in a single location. I have the same system wherever I am and can access it anywhere.

**Reason #4: I keep all my notes inside Notion.** I clip website articles with the Chrome extension, and notes from my Kindle are automatically transferred with Readwise. Then, I can tie notes together by topic or project. In knowledge work, you have to be able to make connections and draw conclusions based on multiple sources and data points. Notion makes this easy.

**Reason #5: I write and create content inside Notion.** As a content creator, writing plays a big role in what I do. Within Notion, I've built courses, managed a podcast, written scripts, blog posts, and social media posts. All these elements (content, tasks, research, projects) are linked together.

Tiago Forte coined the term Second Brain:

> Building a Second Brain is a **methodology for saving and systematically reminding** us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we’ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.

For me, **Notion is my second brain.**
