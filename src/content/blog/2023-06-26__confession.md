I have a confession to make. I had ignored the importance of accessibility until I saw a desperate tweet from a girl, pleading with designers and developers to prioritize accessibility. Her father was blind, and had just about given up. The internet was his primary connection to the world, but most of the sites he would visit were hard to navigate and “read.” He admitted to his daughter that each inaccessible website was a reminder that he wasn’t welcome in this world.

I can’t imagine the pain that this man or his daughter felt. But, as a designer and a developer, I can do something about that. I can educate others, as well as, ensure that all the projects that I work on are accessible. It may only be one website at a time, but, I’m willing to do as much as I can so that everyone feels welcome.
