Here's the secret that no one will tell you: you know what needs to be done. You may not know all the steps, but I'll bet you know the one next, best step.

Say you want to be a developer. Maybe you look at the big goal and have no idea how to get there. But, I bet you can determine the next best step. It could be as small as Google "how do I to become a developer?" Or ask ChatGPT "what are some resources for learning how to code?" The next step is attainable.

Maybe you're weighing a big life decision and you think "I really don't know what needs to be done." You're confusing not knowing the ending with not knowing the next step. Think small. Maybe the next best step is asking for advice. What information are you missing to make a decision?

The trick is to do something.
Maybe you look at the list of all the steps you need to do. It's overwhelming and therefore we don't do anything at all. But, the trick is to do something. Just start. Sometimes that's the hardest part. Once you start, you're able to build momentum. This is pure physics. Newton's first law of motion says “An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.” Start somewhere. Anywhere.
