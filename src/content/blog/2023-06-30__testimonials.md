Testimonials are a powerful tool for building trust with potential customers. Itâ€™s social proof. It adds credibility to your website, product, or service, demonstrating that your offer is valuable and effective.

You know you need testimonials, but how do you go about getting them?

The first step is to ask. Reach out to current or past customers and ask if they would be willing to provide a testimonial. Make it as easy as possible for them by providing a template they can use or asking specific questions to guide them.

If you want to take the pressure off of your customers, try recommending a testimonial and asking for their approval. For example, you could say "I love the way you described our product in our last conversation. Would you be willing to let me use that as a testimonial on our website?"

Another great option is to include a testimonial request as part of your onboarding process. Let customers know up front that you'll be asking for their feedback later. This helps set expectations, prepares them for the ask later, and increases the likelihood that they'll provide a testimonial.

Testimonials are a powerful marketing tool. Don't be afraid to ask for them and showcase them prominently on your website or marketing materials. Besides, in my most cases, people are more than willing to support something they believe in.
