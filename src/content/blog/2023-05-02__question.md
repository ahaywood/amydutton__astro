I built a website for one of my clients. After the project launched, we discovered they weren't receiving email notifications from the contact forms on the site. Several emails with sales inquiries slipped through the cracks, un-responded. This was a painful realization.

After troubleshooting, I realized there was a typo in the email address I was using for my client! When I tested it, I used my email address. Even after the site launched, I continued to receive email notifications successfully and assumed the client did too.

As you can imagine, I had some difficult follow-up conversations with my client. Understandably, they wanted to know how it happened and what went wrong. Truthfully, my client wasn't interested in the technical breakdown. More importantly, **the question behind the question was how do we prevent this from happening again?** Yes, getting to the root of the issue is important, but it's even more important to find a solution, moving beyond the problem. Ask: **What's the resolution you're looking for?** I hate conflict, but approaching a difficult situation with a problem-solving mindset, allows two people to come together to fix a problem instead of tearing each other down and focusing on the things that went wrong.
