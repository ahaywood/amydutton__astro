When you run your own company, it's easy to work IN your company instead of ON it.

When you're working in your company, you're doing the day-to-day work. If you're a service business, it means you're serving clients. If you're a product company, you're focused on building the next feature.

It's easy to fall into this trap. The work is straightforward. It's the task directly in front of you. It's the work that makes money now.

The problem is that you're heads down, blinders on.

## The truth is what got you here won't get you there.

If you're not willing to evolve and change over time, you'll be irrelevant.

Consider your favorite musicians. Some artists have entered your life for a season, and there are ones that have stood the test of time and are still around. Take Taylor Swift, for instance. She signed her first music deal 19 years ago! She's reinvented herself and changed genres multiple times. As a result, she is one of the best-selling musicians in history, having sold over 200 million records globally.

## It's the work that you do for the future that's going to ensure you have a future.

Practically speaking, at ZEAL, we use time on Fridays to level up and pursue tasks that will propel the business forward. As a result, we can stay on top of modern practices and implementations and research the latest technology advancements. **Our business _and_ our clients are better for it.**
