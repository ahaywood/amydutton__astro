By all intents and purposes, I had made it. I was making more money doing freelance full-time than in a corporate job. I could define my own schedule, work from home (before that was a thing), and take as many vacation days as I wanted.

## The problem was:

I worked in my business, not on it.
As a web designer and developer, I designed and built websites for all my clients except myself. In 7 years, I never once updated my website! My business was helping others, but I never helped myself.

**I was reactionary instead of strategic.** I responded to my client's needs without taking care of my own. As long as you're focused on the problem directly in front of you, it's impossible to grow. You can't look to the future and make bigger decisions with long-term benefits.

**I operated as a freelancer instead of a business owner.** I thought small and did everything myself. What a missed opportunity!

If I had taken the time to work on my business, not just doing the day-to-day work, my client's experience and my own would have improved.
